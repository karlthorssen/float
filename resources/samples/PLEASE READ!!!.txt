hi, this is flowers in narnia. first of all i hope you enjoy this kit as much as i enjoyed making it (which is not that much) anyway this kit was made for those people that wanna get into old school rap but dont really know where to find some usable sounds. 
secondly, i wanna say that the samples in this are NOT royalty free, they are copyrighted material. don't let me catch you complaining b*tch this was a free kit, that's all, thank you for your support
- with love, fin


here's some tips for boom bap beat making: 
shift the hats off the grid this will help with the bounce a lot
keep it simple, don't overdo the kicks or else you will ruin that bounce
sidechain the kick to the hats so whenever the kick hits, the hats go down in volume by a bit, this will help emulate that vintage feel idk how BUT IT WILL BITCH DAMN


go follow me on my social medias and tell me how much you loved/hated this shit
